# sge-maketask
## script for creating and running speechbrain (not only) tasks on sge

```sh
make_exp -h
```


TODOs:
- before running the script, there's need to change `$OWNER` in the `make_exp.sh` file
- make optional email nootifications
- better error reporting
- rewrite in python? Everyone loves python !
- many other things (perhaps)
